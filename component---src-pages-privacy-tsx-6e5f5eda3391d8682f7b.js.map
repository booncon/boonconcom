Cookies</h4>\n        <p>\n          The Internet pages of the booncon oy use cookies. Cookies are text\n          files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a\n          so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.\n          It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and\n          servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the\n          cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to\n          differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other\n          Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet\n          browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Through the use of cookies, the booncon oy can provide the users of\n          this website with more user-friendly services that would not be\n          possible without the cookie setting.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be\n          optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously\n          mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this\n          recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The\n          website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access\n          data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by\n          the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer\n          system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online\n          shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has\n          placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies\n          through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the\n          Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of\n          cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time\n          via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible\n          in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the\n          setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of\n          our website may be entirely usable.\n        </p>\n        <h4>4. Collection of general data and information</h4>\n        <p>\n          The website of the booncon oy collects a series of general data and\n          information when a data subject or automated system calls up the\n          website. This general data and information are stored in the server\n          log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used,\n          (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website\n          from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called\n          referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to\n          the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7)\n          the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any\n          other similar data and information that may be used in the event of\n          attacks on our information technology systems.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When using these general data and information, the booncon oy does not\n          draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information\n          is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2)\n          optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3)\n          ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems\n          and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities\n          with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a\n          cyber-attack. Therefore, the booncon oy analyzes anonymously collected\n          data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the\n          data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an\n          optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The\n          anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all\n          personal data provided by a data subject.\n        </p>\n        <h4>5. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data</h4>\n        <p>\n          The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the\n          data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of\n          storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or\n          other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is\n          subject to.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period\n          prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator\n          expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in\n          accordance with legal requirements.\n        </p>\n        <h4>6.

Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google\n          Analytics (with anonymization function)\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google\n          Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web\n          analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and\n          analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web\n          analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from\n          which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were\n          visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web\n          analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in\n          order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600\n          Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the\n          application “_gat. _anonymizeIp”. By means of this application the IP\n          address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by\n          Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State\n          of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on\n          the European Economic Area.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the\n          traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and\n          information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to\n          provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and\n          to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for\n          us.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system\n          of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above.\n          With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use\n          of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of\n          this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which\n          a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on\n          the information technology system of the data subject will\n          automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for\n          the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to\n          Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise\n          Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address\n          of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand\n          the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission\n          settlements.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access\n          time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency\n          of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our\n          Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the\n          Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to\n          Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored\n          by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these\n          personal data collected through the technical procedure to third\n          parties.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies\n          through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment\n          of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of\n          cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also\n          prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information\n          technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in\n          use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser\n          or other software programs.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a\n          collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is\n          related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this\n          data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose,\n          the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link\n          https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser\n          add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and\n          information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted\n          to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is\n          considered an objection by Google. If the information technology\n          system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly\n          installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to\n          disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the\n          data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere\n          of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the\n          reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of\n          Google may be retrieved under\n          https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under\n          http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html.

Data protection provisions about the application and use of\n          Instagram\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          On this website, the controller has integrated components of the\n          service Instagram. Instagram is a service that may be qualified as an\n          audiovisual platform, which allows users to share photos and videos,\n          as well as disseminate such data in other social networks.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The operating company of the services offered by Instagram is\n          Instagram LLC, 1 Hacker Way, Building 14 First Floor, Menlo Park, CA,\n          UNITED STATES.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet\n          site, which is operated by the controller and on which an Instagram\n          component (Insta button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the\n          information technology system of the data subject is automatically\n          prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding Instagram\n          component of Instagram. During the course of this technical procedure,\n          Instagram becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was\n          visited by the data subject.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram,\n          Instagram detects with every call-up to our website by the data\n          subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet\n          site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the\n          data subject. This information is collected through the Instagram\n          component and is associated with the respective Instagram account of\n          the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram\n          buttons integrated on our website, then Instagram matches this\n          information with the personal Instagram user account of the data\n          subject and stores the personal data.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Instagram receives information via the Instagram component that the\n          data subject has visited our website provided that the data subject is\n          logged in at Instagram at the time of the call to our website. This\n          occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Instagram button\n          or not. If such a transmission of information to Instagram is not\n          desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by\n          logging off from their Instagram account before a call-up to our\n          website is made.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of\n          Instagram may be retrieved under\n          https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388 and\n          https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/.\n        </p>\n        <h4>\n          10. Data protection provisions about the application and use of\n          Twitter\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          On this website, the controller has integrated components of Twitter.\n          Twitter is a multilingual, publicly-accessible microblogging service\n          on which users may publish and spread so-called ‘tweets,’ e.g. short\n          messages, which are limited to 280 characters. These short messages\n          are available for everyone, including those who are not logged on to\n          Twitter. The tweets are also displayed to so-called followers of the\n          respective user. Followers are other Twitter users who follow a user’s\n          tweets. Furthermore, Twitter allows you to address a wide audience via\n          hashtags, links or retweets.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street,\n          Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, UNITED STATES.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet\n          site, which is operated by the controller and on which a Twitter\n          component (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the\n          information technology system of the data subject is automatically\n          prompted to download a display of the corresponding Twitter component\n          of Twitter. Further information about the Twitter buttons is available\n          under https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons. During the\n          course of this technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what\n          specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. The\n          purpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a\n          retransmission of the contents of this website to allow our users to\n          introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our visitor\n          numbers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter, Twitter\n          detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject and for\n          the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site which specific\n          sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This\n          information is collected through the Twitter component and associated\n          with the respective Twitter account of the data subject. If the data\n          subject clicks on one of the Twitter buttons integrated on our\n          website, then Twitter assigns this information to the personal Twitter\n          user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Twitter receives information via the Twitter component that the data\n          subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is\n          logged in on Twitter at the time of the call-up to our website. This\n          occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Twitter\n          component or not. If such a transmission of information to Twitter is\n          not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by\n          logging off from their Twitter account before a call-up to our website\n          is made.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The applicable data protection provisions of Twitter may be accessed\n          under https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en.\n        </p>\n        <h4>11. Legal basis for the processing </h4>\n        <p>\n          Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing\n          operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing\n          purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the\n          performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is\n          the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for\n          the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is\n          based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing\n          operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual\n          measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products\n          or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which\n          processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment\n          of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.\n          <br />\n          In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to\n          protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural\n          person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured\n          in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital\n          information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other\n          third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d\n          GDPR.\n          <br />\n          Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f\n          GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not\n          covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is\n          necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our\n          company or by a third party, except where such interests are\n          overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the\n          data subject which require protection of personal data. Such\n          processing operations are particularly permissible because they have\n          been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered\n          that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a\n          client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n        </p>\n        <h4>\n          12. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third\n          party\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f\n          GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of\n          the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.\n        </p>\n        <h4>13. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h4>\n        <p>\n          The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data\n          is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that\n          period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is\n          no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the\n          initiation of a contract.\n        </p>\n        <h4>\n          14. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual\n          requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract;\n          Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible\n          consequences of failure to provide such data{\" \"}\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by\n          law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual\n          provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data\n          subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be\n          processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide\n          us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or\n          her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence\n          that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject\n          must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject\n          whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or\n          contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether\n          there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the\n          consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n        </p>\n        <h4>15. Existence of automated decision-making</h4>\n        <p>\n          As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or\n          profiling.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This Privacy Policy has been generated by the Privacy Policy Generator\n          of the{\" \"}\n          <Link href=\"https://dg-datenschutz.de/?lang=en\">\n            German Association for Data Protection\n          </Link>{\" \"}\n          that was developed in cooperation with{\" \"}\n          <Link href=\"https://www.wbs-law.de/eng/practice-areas/internet-law/it-law/\">\n            Privacy Lawyers\n          </Link>{\" \"}\n          from WILDE BEUGER SOLMECKE, Cologne.\n        </p>\n      </Box>\n      <Link to=\"/\" sx={{ fontSize: [2, 3, 4] }} as={GatsbyLink}>\n        Go back to the homepage\n      </Link>\n    </Box>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default PodcastPage\n"
