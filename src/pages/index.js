          We are booncon, we are changing the way people experience work. As the

          We see ourselves as business builders and just love coming up with new
          concepts.
          <br />
          <br />
          Experiences from our work and cooperations with different companies
          have proven we are on the right track. Work is not a job and working
          with friends is awesome. booncon is all about learning from each other
          and sharing experiences. We strongly believe in mixing people from
          different backgrounds and blending startup ideology with the power of
          established companies.
